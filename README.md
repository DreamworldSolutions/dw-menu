# Design Decisions
- No property to configure animation. Animation style would be as suggested by the material standards.

# Future Enhancements
- Keyboard Navigation
- Custom Footer (via `slot` or template override)
- Group Items (divider)
- Tooltip for the Disabled Items.
- Expandable Menu Items
- `href` (Link) support for an Item. It may be set to open in a new window only. In that case, itâ€™s trailing icon is also auto-chosen.
- Sub-Menu: Opens another menu on the side of the current menu. (Long-term deferred)
